# directus
A collection of Directus plugins we created and maintain at Jamtastic!

## 🐰 &nbsp; Directus

Directus is an open-source data management system. To quote the source:

> **Directus is an Open Data Platform built to democratize the database.**
> 
> This platform provides everyone on your team, regardless of technical skill, equal access to data and digital file asset management, for any data model or project. First, link Directus to your desired SQL database and file storage adapter. After that, Directus enables you to perform CRUD operations, create users, assign roles with fully configurable permissions, build complex and granular queries, configure event-driven webhooks and task automation... the list goes on!



## 🧩 &nbsp; Extensions

Extensions maintained by *Jamtastic!* are categorised into three broad categories: integration extensions, [app extensions](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/introduction.html#app-extensions) and [API extensions](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/introduction.html#api-extensions).

### Integrations

These extensions work best as a suite of plugins, usually to provide integration of an external service.
