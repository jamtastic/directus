A collection of Directus plugins we created and maintain at Jamtastic!

## 🐰 &nbsp; Directus

Directus is an open-source data management system.

## 🧩 &nbsp; Extensions

Extensions maintained by *Jamtastic!* are categorised into three broad categories: integration extensions, [app extensions](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/introduction.html#app-extensions) and [API extensions](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/introduction.html#api-extensions).

### Integrations

These extensions work best as a suite of plugins, usually to provide integration of an external service.
